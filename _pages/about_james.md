James Holehouse is a Mathematical Biologist and Complexity Scientist, and is the PI of the $R^3$ Lab at WashU. He received his PhD from the University of Edinburgh in October 2022 in Mathematical Biology from the lab of [Ramon Grima](https://grimagroup.bio.ed.ac.uk/home). Prior to joining WashU's department of Biology, he spent his postdoc years at the [Santa Fe Institute](https://www.santafe.edu/), in New Mexico, working on questions relating to the "Rules of Life". He believes that life is the origin of the universe's complex rule systems.

James' interests span the growth of rules and regulations in Biology and Society, and the role that randomness plays in their evolution. He typically employs methods from Non-equilibrium Statistical Physics, Systems Biology and Evolutionary Biology to research these topics. Some of James' most recent projects involve: 
- Categorizing the growth of rule systems in sport and US governance.
- Understanding the relationships between the organization of cells, federal agencies and cities.
- Exploring the role of transient behavioral modes in gene regulatory mechanisms.
