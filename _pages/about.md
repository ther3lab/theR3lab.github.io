### We study the growth of rules and regulations across Biology and Society, and the role that randomness plays in shaping system function and structure.

Some questions driving our research:
- In what ways are biological regulations networks like social rule books?
- How does biochemical randomness complicate our understanding of genetic regulation?
- What are the constraints dictating how regulatory systems diversify, specialize and coordinate themselves?

The Lab is activeley recruiting PhD students and Postdocs from Comp+Math Bio, Applied Math, and Statistical Physics backgroundsâ€”please get in touch!
